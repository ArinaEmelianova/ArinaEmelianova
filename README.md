## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Arina.
I'm 27 years old and I'm just starting my way in programming.
It's strange, because I'm a construction engineer by education and programming is not really my thing.
But things are changing and that's great.
I am a very responsible and diligent person, I have been doing what I want since high school.
So let's watch together how I learn new skills.
